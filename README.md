# Support-Vector-Machines-with-Python

In this repo i have practiced support vector machines (SVM) algorithm on the scikit learn's built in breast cancer data set.
the algorithm worked quite well on this dataset giving a 95% accuracy
In this example i have also used grid search for the search of best parameters.
